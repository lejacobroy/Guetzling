# Introduction

Guetzling is a simple script for macOS and Linux written in Bash to automate (recursively finding files) the compression of JPGs and PNGs using the Guetzli algorithm.

By design, Guetzling will overwrite and/or delete your original files.  If you want to keep your originals, make a backup of your folder before using Guetzling.

## Install Guetzli
1. Install [Guetzli](https://github.com/google/guetzli), via the directions provided at the link.
2. Copy Guetzling, copy it to `/usr/bin`.

## Usage
1. Simply `cd` to the parent directory of your choice, and `guetzling`. ***Voil√†!***
